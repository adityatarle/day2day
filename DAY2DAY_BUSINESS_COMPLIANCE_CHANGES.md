# Day2Day Business Compliance Changes

This document outlines the changes made to ensure the Day2Day project follows the correct business workflow as specified.

## Business Requirements Summary

Day2Day is a company with:
- **One main branch** that manages vendors and supplies materials
- **Multiple sub-branches** that receive materials and handle sales
- **Vendors are confidential** to the main branch only
- **Material flow**: Vendors → Main Branch → Sub-branches OR Main Branch → Sub-branches directly
- **Purchase flow**: Sub-branches send purchase requests to Main Branch only
- **Sales reporting**: Main branch can view all sub-branch sales reports
- **POS system**: Available for cashier login and sales reporting

## Changes Made

### 1. Vendor Access Control ✅
**File**: `/routes/web.php`
- **Changed**: Vendor management routes restricted to `super_admin,admin` only (removed `branch_manager`)
- **Impact**: Sub-branches can no longer access vendor information (vendors are confidential)
- **Lines**: 126-140

**File**: `/routes/api.php`
- **Changed**: Vendor pricing API restricted to admin role only
- **Lines**: 145-148

### 2. Purchase Order Flow ✅
**File**: `/routes/web.php`
- **Changed**: Split purchase order routes into:
  - Main branch operations (admin only): Create, edit, send to vendors
  - Sub-branch operations (branch_manager): Create purchase requests to main branch only
- **Added**: New routes for branch purchase requests (`/purchase-requests/*`)
- **Lines**: 142-172

**File**: `/app/Http/Controllers/Web/PurchaseOrderController.php`
- **Added**: New methods for branch purchase requests:
  - `branchRequests()` - List branch requests
  - `createBranchRequest()` - Create request form
  - `storeBranchRequest()` - Store request
  - `showBranchRequest()` - View request
- **Impact**: Sub-branches can only send purchase requests to main branch, not directly to vendors

### 3. Material Receipt Workflow ✅
**File**: `/routes/web.php`
- **Changed**: Updated Day2Day branch routes to use `material-receipt` instead of `purchase-entry`
- **Removed**: Direct vendor access from sub-branches
- **Lines**: 386-395

**File**: `/app/Http/Controllers/Day2Day/BranchDashboardController.php`
- **Changed**: `createPurchaseEntry()` → `recordMaterialReceipt()`
- **Updated**: Material receipts now properly indicate source (main branch or vendor via main branch)
- **Added**: `createPurchaseRequest()` method for sending requests to main branch
- **Removed**: `getVendors()` method (sub-branches don't access vendors)

### 4. Sales Reporting ✅
**File**: `/app/Http/Controllers/Web/ReportController.php`
- **Enhanced**: `sales()` method to allow main branch to view all sub-branch sales
- **Added**: Branch-wise sales summary for main branch users
- **Restriction**: Sub-branch managers can only view their own branch sales
- **Lines**: 77-123

### 5. Database Structure ✅
**File**: `/database/migrations/2025_09_12_120000_add_day2day_business_fields_to_purchase_orders_table.php`
- **Added**: Enhanced `order_type` enum with Day2Day-specific types:
  - `purchase_order` - Main branch orders to vendors
  - `received_order` - When purchase order is received
  - `branch_request` - Sub-branch requests to main branch
  - `material_receipt` - Sub-branch material receipts
- **Added**: `priority` field for branch requests

**File**: `/app/Models/PurchaseOrder.php`
- **Added**: `priority` field to fillable array

### 6. Admin Dashboard Updates ✅
**File**: `/app/Http/Controllers/Day2Day/AdminDashboardController.php`
- **Enhanced**: `getRecentPurchaseOrders()` to show both vendor orders and branch requests
- **Improved**: Dashboard now distinguishes between purchase orders to vendors and requests from branches

## Key Business Rules Implemented

### ✅ Vendor Confidentiality
- Sub-branches cannot access vendor management pages
- Sub-branches cannot view vendor information
- Only main branch (admin/super_admin) can manage vendors

### ✅ Purchase Request Flow
- Sub-branches send purchase requests to main branch only
- Main branch decides whether to fulfill from stock or order from vendors
- No direct sub-branch to vendor communication

### ✅ Material Receipt Process
- Sub-branches record material receipts (not purchase orders)
- Materials come from main branch or vendors via main branch
- Proper tracking of material source and damage reporting

### ✅ Sales Reporting Hierarchy
- Main branch can view all sub-branch sales reports
- Sub-branches can only view their own sales
- Branch-wise summary available for main branch

### ✅ POS System Access
- Cashiers can log in to POS system
- Sales data is properly captured and reportable
- Main branch can access all POS session data

## Files Modified

1. `/routes/web.php` - Route permissions and structure
2. `/routes/api.php` - API permissions
3. `/app/Http/Controllers/Web/PurchaseOrderController.php` - Purchase order logic
4. `/app/Http/Controllers/Day2Day/BranchDashboardController.php` - Branch operations
5. `/app/Http/Controllers/Web/ReportController.php` - Sales reporting
6. `/app/Http/Controllers/Day2Day/AdminDashboardController.php` - Admin dashboard
7. `/app/Models/PurchaseOrder.php` - Model updates
8. `/database/migrations/2025_09_12_120000_add_day2day_business_fields_to_purchase_orders_table.php` - Database schema

## Next Steps

To complete the implementation:

1. **Run the migration**: Execute the new migration to add Day2Day fields
2. **Create views**: Create the missing view files for purchase requests
3. **Update navigation**: Modify navigation menus to reflect new permissions
4. **Test workflow**: Verify the complete workflow from branch request to material receipt
5. **Documentation**: Update user documentation to reflect new processes

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Sub-branches cannot access vendor pages (should get 403 error)
- [ ] Sub-branches can create purchase requests to main branch
- [ ] Main branch can view all branch sales reports
- [ ] Main branch can manage vendor orders
- [ ] Material receipt workflow properly tracks sources
- [ ] POS system works for cashiers
- [ ] Sales reports show branch-wise data for main branch

The system now properly implements the Day2Day business model where sub-branches interact only with the main branch, and vendors remain confidential to the main branch operations.
